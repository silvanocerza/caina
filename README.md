# Caina (ˈkai̯na)

This is supposed to be a BitTorrent client.
As of now it's just a small CLI that reads .torrent files and prints their information in human readable form.

```bash
$ caina ubuntu-23.10.1-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent
ubuntu-23.10.1-desktop-amd64.iso
Tracker: https://torrent.ubuntu.com/announce
Piece length: 262144
Number of pieces: 19738
File bytes: 5173995520
```

I'm work on the project whenever I feel like it, when it's stable enough it will be released.
